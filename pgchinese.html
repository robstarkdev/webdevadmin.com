    Just over thirty years ago, I first went to China during a study abroad program. By 1993 I had obtained a bachelors degree in Chinese, which required four (4) years' worth of Chinese language study (we had an accelerated program where one could take first and second-year Chinese within the compressed time span of one academic year). I also took third-year Chinese and a combined year of Classical Chinese and Chinese linguistics. I wrote my tests in Chinese characters. I'm completely fluent in written and spoken Chinese (Mandarin). Some highlights of my experience with China and Chinese:
