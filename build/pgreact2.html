    My goal is to use React (in both its web and mobile development flavors) as much as possible going forward. Although I recently was paid to build a web app in Vue, I prefer React and want to stick with it. Below you can visit the links to a React Native app I build recently and published in both the Apple App Store and on Google play. You can also view some of my React code in the context of a Github repository <a href="https://github.com/robstarkdev/webdevadmin.com/blob/master/src/index.js" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>.

    I love building applications and websites with React. One feature of React I particularly appreciate is "CSS-in-JS"; and indeed HTML in javascript as well via JSX. The ability to view everything related to a particular aspect of your webpage/site in one location is a wonderful benefit.  My preferred method of implementing this is by using the package "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/css">Emotion CSS</a>", which has a weekly downloads count of around 3.3 million.

    However, I am fully committed to using whatever technologies, be they legacy or otherwise, that my supervisor/manager prefers me to use. And this includes all details regarding variable naming schemes and other coding conventions.

    Below are two videos I made for my Youtube channel which relate to React:
