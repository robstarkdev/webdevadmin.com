    You can view two projects I have built with react: 1) this site was built with React, and 2) a specific page here <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webdevadmin.com/gallery/">www.WebDevAdmin.com/gallery</a> is something I built for someone else. If you prefer to view code in the context of a Github repository, you can browse the code for the first example above at <a href="https://github.com/robstarkdev/webdevadmin.com/blob/master/src/index.js" target="_blank">this Github location</a>.

    I love building applications and websites with React. One feature of React I particularly appreciate is "CSS-in-JS"; and indeed HTML in javascript as well via JSX. The ability to view everything related to a particular aspect of your webpage/site in one location is a wonderful benefit.  My preferred method of implementing this is by using the package "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/css">Emotion CSS</a>", which has a weekly downloads count of around 3.3 million.
    <br><br>
    However, I am fully committed to using whatever technologies, be they legacy or otherwise, that my supervisor/manager prefers me to use. And this includes all details regarding variable naming schemes and other coding conventions.

    Below are two videos I made for my Youtube channel which relate to React:
