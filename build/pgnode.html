One of my motivations for learning and using Node is the desire to consolidate the "linguistic" toolset I use for programming. That is, for example, I get tired of declaring an associative array one way in PHP, and in another with javascript (in fact they're objects in javascript!). I prefer the syntax of javascript over PHP (usually), and javascript does not have a sunset looming in the horizon (this, too, is arguable given small business' infatuation with Wordpress). I don't believe that Node is a better tool than PHP for every job/task. I don't think the reader needs me to discuss this any further, so I'll stop at that.
    <br><br>
    I have had a few applications that made use of the fact that Nodejs is asynchronous, and I have really appreciated this aspect of it. The vast majority of my work until now, on the other hand, has not absolutely required asynchronicity. I've made the decision to make Javascript/Node/NPM etc. my programming base. Even if my next job involves 90% PHP legacy code maintenance, I'm going to continue to solidfy my grasp of Javascript programming for Web/Mobile/Desktop; even if I am doing it in my spare time.

    I have used Node to:

    <ul>
        <li>In conjunction with Nginx, Node is serving the files for this very website you're looking at.</li>
        <li>Automate Server-side Configurations, SSL Certificates, and DNS through Shell Scripts Written in Node (<a
                href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs">NPM package ShellJS</a>) </li>
        <li>Create Websites Using Handlebars and EJS HTML Templating Systems</li>
        <li>Handle Web Requests Asynchronously in a Webscraper which Uses CheerioJs</li>
        <li>Save Data in MySQL Asynchronously</li>

    </ul>
