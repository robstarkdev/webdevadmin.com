    For about three years (2007-2010) I built websites with the old .NET Framework and ASP.NET/Visual Basic. Then, roughly ten years ago, I switched to what Microsoft technologies were NOT at that time: <strong>open source</strong>. I'm aware that the new .NET "core" is open source, but that's as much as I know about it.

 Licensing fees all over the place started to spring up unexpected: and not just in the Microsoft core products themselves. I had a rude awakening regarding Crytstal Reports licenses (at that time they were about $315 per server/IP, and this was a terribly disguised and hidden gotcha). These licensing fees issues never had a significant impact on my clients/employers satisfaction with the results I produced. However, they did make it infeasible to scale and sell an application to others. A $315 licensing fee will be readily paid by a business that is already seeing great results from a well-functioning application they know they need. However, it's obviously another story when you want to offer free trials for potential future customers with whom trust has not yet been built. It also would have greatly hampered profitability. This was a characterstic of virtually all sofware applications in the Microsoft ecosystem at the time.

    I have great respect for the business-oriented nature of many Microsoft technologies and tools, and for Visual Studio. I currently use PHPStorm and Webstorm for React and Node. There are some benefits to having a behemoth company plan and roll out a system and scheme for coding/building things.

    Things have changed much, I've heard, in the world of Microsoft coding. However, I've long since made the switch. That is not to say I would not take a job in this area now. I could possibly do that, but might need to relearn some things, depending on my particular role(s) in a team.
