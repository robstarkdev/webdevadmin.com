    However, I am fully committed to using whatever technologies, be they legacy or otherwise, that my supervisor/manager prefers me to use. And this includes all details regarding variable naming schemes and other coding conventions. At my last employer (a company with gross revenues of over $97 million per year (2019)), 95% of their webpage-based employee tools did NOT use any "modern" javascript framework (React/Vue/Angular). Even on new projects, they used vanilla javascript and jQuery. If it is not broken, it may be best not to "fix" legacy code, but just modify it in place.

    <ul>
        <li>Canvas</li>
        <li>jQuery: many apps</li>
        <li>ES6 modern js syntax</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
