    My Spanish is conversational level, and I don't claim to have a professional speaking ability. I welcome tests on the spot! Just start speaking Spanish with me and see how I respond. Give me something to read, and I'll give an explanation of the content in Spanish. Like most, my reading comprehension is much greater than my speaking ability.

    <br><br>
    Much of my ability to comprehend Spanish derives from having lived and worked in Brazil for a number of years. A decade or so ago, I could speak a good bit of Portuguese.  Since then, I've made an attempt to formally learn the differences in Spanish pronunciation and grammar on my own. I'm self and Youtube-taught.

 After having mastered Chinese, and having taught English on an off for a number of years, I'm finding the process of learning Spanish very fun and interesting; and not at all daunting. I appreciate far more about the langauge learning process than I did thirty years ago when I began this sort of "mountain climbing" at the University of Washington.

    I speak conversational Spanish and my reading ability is much higher than that. My Spanish is not at a "professional" level, and I'm not making any claims to that effect. However, an example will give you an idea of where I am with it: if a project manager sent me an email that described what an application was intended to do, and a list of features, I could spend a bit of time reading and understand what was called for. I may need to consult a dictionary, and I may not. This is because virtually every vocabulary item I don't currently know is already a cognate, and can be guessed. This guess/inferring in reading comprehension is a time-honored practice in language learning.  I could not, however, extemporaneously make the same description myself in spoken Spanish. No, I couldn't do that at all.

    Written Portuguese and Spanish are nearly identical, and my time spent in Portuguese continues to give me a huge leg-up in Spanish.
