    My Spanish is conversational level, and I don't claim to have a professional speaking ability. I welcome tests on the spot! Just start speaking Spanish with me and see how I respond. Give me something to read, and I'll give an explanation of the content in Spanish. Like most, my reading comprehension is much greater than my speaking ability.

    Much of my ability to comprehend Spanish derives from having lived and worked in Brazil for a number of years. A decade or so ago, I could speak a good bit of Portuguese.  Since then, I've made an attempt to formally learn the differences in Spanish pronunciation and grammar on my own. I'm self and Youtube-taught.
