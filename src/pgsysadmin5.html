    Although I've mostly worked with Linux administration, I am extremely keen on the Google Cloud Platform and its Firebase "serverless" suite of products. It makes massive infrastructure and scale available to small and medium-sized businesses at an affordable rate.

    Most of my system administration has been in software installation and maintenance on Linux CentOS and Ubuntu. I also maintained a Windows Server (version 2003) for a little over three years in 2007-2010 running ASP.NET and had websites on it. Also, I have done a little work with Powershell and an Active Directory instance that talked to roughly 200 windows PCs spread out over eight offices in three different states.
