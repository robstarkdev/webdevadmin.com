    For about three years (2007-2010) I built websites with the old .NET Framework and ASP.NET/Visual Basic. Then, roughly ten years ago, I switched to what Microsoft technologies were NOT at that time: <strong>open source</strong>. I'm aware that the new .NET "core" is open source, but that's as much as I know about it.

    Things have changed much, I've heard, in the world of Microsoft coding. However, I've long since made the switch. That is not to say I would not take a job in this area now. I could possibly do that, but might need to relearn some things, depending on my particular role(s) in a team.

    <ul>
        <li>Client Instake System Using ASP.NET Website, Export of Client Data to Legal Pleadings via Crystal Reports</li>
        <li>Configured Websites and IIS with Batch Files and Visual Basic</li>
        <li>Used Visual Studio Tools for RAD (Rapid Application Development)</li>
        <li>Maintained Dedicated Server for Roughly Four Years Running Windows Server 2003</li>

        <li>Use of SQL Server Express</li>
        <li>Basic HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>

    </ul>
