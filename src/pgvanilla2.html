    My last employer had hundreds of webpage-based tools which had been built many years ago using "plain" javascript and jQuery. These tools are used by hundreds of employees on a daily basis, and they fulfill their purposes sufficiently. I was often tasked with modifying those pre-existing "legacy" code bases. I fully appreciate that it is often economically infeasible to rebuild assets using the "latest and greatest" bright, shiny frameworks and libraries.

   As a programming language, javascript gives us the ability to kill so many birds with this one stone: browser, server, iPhone/Adroid devices, the desktop now with Electron etc.. Here are some highlights of my Vanilla javascript and jQuery experience (most complex tools made for companies can NOT be shown due to intellectual property laws and trade secrets):


    <ul>
        <li>Use of Canvas Element to Allow Supervisors to Mark up and Draw Directly on Base64 Images Loaded from an API</li>
        <li>Javascript Drag and Drop Using jQuery, Drop Event Invoked Queries and Updates to Company API</li>
        <li>Ajax on Webpages to Interact with Company API</li>
        <li>JSON Data Structures Sent To/From API</li>
        <li>Create Connnections between Complex Datastructures and UI Elements in Browser</li>
        <li>Handle Complex Data Transmission and Receipt from API/Server</li>
        <li>Daily Use of Chrome Debugging Tools</li>

    </ul>

    Just below is an application I built that involved drag and drop and substantial communication with a backend API.
