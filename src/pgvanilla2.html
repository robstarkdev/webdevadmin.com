    My last employer had hundreds of webpage-based tools which had been built many years ago using "plain" javascript and jQuery. These tools are used by hundreds of employees on a daily basis, and they fulfill their purposes sufficiently. I was often tasked with modifying those pre-existing "legacy" code bases. I fully appreciate that it is often economically infeasible to rebuild assets using the "latest and greatest" bright, shiny frameworks and libraries.
    <br><br>
   As a programming language, javascript gives us the ability to kill so many birds with this one stone: browser, server, iPhone/Adroid devices, the desktop now with Electron etc.. Here are some highlights of my Vanilla javascript and jQuery experience (most complex tools made for companies can NOT be shown due to intellectual property laws and trade secrets):

<!--

    --Most if not all, of the applications are protected by intellectual property laws and laws relating to trade secrets: they're the property of the company and thus I can neither show themm in operation, and nor can I reveal the source code, but will do my best to describe them and the technologies i used to build them

    --Canvas timecards at terra (link up some github code)

    --OnDemand application whereby employees are matched to jobs

    -- drag and drop, fire database queries and updates

    --continual use of Ajax to interact with company API, I also modified and added to the API including complex SQL queries used with MS SQL server and MySQL

    --jQuery: terra used it, very fast with it, many plugins including select2 massive customizations, also used
        in my own sites: link to a few of them, www.int-amg.org,

    --ES6 syntax increasingly using it

    --Dashboards showing company statistics: it was configurable with a global JSON configuration file.

        <li>Ajax on Webpages to Interact with Company API</li>

    Just below is an application I built that involved drag and drop and substantial communication with a backend API.
