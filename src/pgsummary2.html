    Anything you want to acheive in the browser, or on the server: I can do it. If you want a "serverless" solution I have used Google Cloud's Firebase and love it. The site you're looking at right now is coming to you from Firebase hosting, and it was built with React. Although, I have mainly used PHP and the .Net framework, I have fallen in love with React and React Native. Over the last 3 years I have been increasingly using React and React Native (view a recent iPhone/Android app I created with React Native and published in both App stores:

    <br><br>
    I produce high-quality code quickly, and charge competitive prices. I'm fully willing to work on a contract basis until an employer has the time and opportunity to fully assess the "proof in the pudding."  As to tools/technology: although I love Facebook's React library, I will use any programming language/library of choice selected by my manager. And the same goes for all coding practices and conventions already existing in the team/company for whom I work. If my employer needs me to learn something new to tackle a problem, I'll just do it.
    <br><br>
     My most recent employer was a company with gross revenues (2019) of $97 million, where I was part of a team of four programmers. I handled both front and backend tasks: from the creation of very complex SQL queries in the company API to complex javascript applications and user interfaces. After fourteen (14) months work at the company, they were sad to see me go (and are part of my references), but I was destined for warm weather and am not willing to continue living in the rainy and chilly Seattle-area. I was not terminated or let-go or down-sized in any way, for reasons of Covid-19 or otherwise. I left because I love warm, sunny weather. And detest the rain and cold of Seattle.
    <br><br>
    Depending on the needs of the particular task/project, I can use entity-relationship and use case diagrams in project planning.

    <br><br>
        I am looking for a remote position, but plan on eventually living permanently in Florida or perhaps Texas. I'm competent in the following areas:

        <ul>
            <li>React and React Native</li>
            <li>Firebase from the Google Cloud Platform</li>
            <li>LAMP Stack Development</li>
            <li>React/Node-based Websites and Applications</li>
            <li>Complex SQL in the Relational Databases MySQL and MS SQL Server</li>
            <li>Complex HTML/CSS User Interfaces, And Coded Very Quickly</li>
            <li>Linux Webserver Installation, Configuration and Maintenance</li>

        </ul>

    Although I do not use the .NET framework now, I used the old version from 2007-2010 to build ASP.NET websites with Visual Basic. I made a complex client intake system for a small business that would export data relating to clients to PDF reports. The reports, created by Crystal Reports, were then filed with the King County Electronic Court Filing system. During the same period of time I maintained a dedicated server running Windows Server 2003; for a total of about four years.
