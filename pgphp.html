   In 2014 I began using PHP on a consistent basis. From 2014 to 2018 I built 40+ websites for small businesses in Asia, primarily in Hong Kong and mainland China. From August 2019 to November 2020 I worked for a medium-sized company, which has offices in four states, whose entire API was written in PHP (and javascript/jQuery on the front-end).

   Over the last seven years I have used PHP to:

   <ul>

      <li>Create and Modify Images (including watermarking images and changing image type/quality/size)</li>
