   In 2014 I began using PHP on a consistent basis. From August 2019 to November 2020 I worked for a company whose entire API was written in PHP, and javascript/jQuery on the front-end.

   <br><br>
   Over the last seven years I have used PHP to:

   <ul>
      <li>Create Dynamic SQL Queries for Backend API</li>
      <li>Create and Modify Images (including watermarking images and changing image type/quality/size)</li>
      <li>Initiate and Manage Sessions</li>
      <li>Encrypt Passwords</li>
      <li>Perform Various Types of Network Requests</li>
      <li>Structure and Organize the Presentation of HTML into Partials/Includes</li>
      <li>Create Page Templates ("Smarty" templating system)</li>
      <li>JSON Data Exchange with Frontend</li>
      <li>Reporting Solutions for the Automated Creation of Temporary Employee Contracts and Documents</li>
      <li>Overall API Creation Based on PHP</li>
      <li>Object Oriented PHP for DRY Coding Practices</li>
   </ul>
