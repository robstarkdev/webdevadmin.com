   You can call anytime but please send a follow up email as well to ensure we get in touch. Of course you can also "add me" on Wechat (get the code at the bottom of the page or on the contact page). Feel free to ask any questions about deadlines and capabilities (I can't conceive of any small or <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">medium-sized business</a> neeeding something I could not provide, however, for some projects you'd perhaps have to hire me full-time for a bit).

   Again, please do also send an email in addition to calling because when I do my coding I like to have the phone off. This way I can follow up with you if I've missed your call. If you anticipate databases with millions of records that won't be the slightest problem. All of the technologies I use scale extremely well. Just ask yourself: if PHP and MySQL are good enough for Wikipedia, aren't they good enough for my business? You bet they are. Those are the well-known and reliable technologies I use.
