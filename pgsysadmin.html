    Most of my system administration has been in the context of Linux web server configurations, maintenance and software installation (CentOS and Ubuntu). I also maintained a Windows Server (version 2003) for a little over three years in 2007-2010 running ASP.NET and had websites on it. Also, I have done a little work with Powershell and an Active Directory instance that talked to roughly 200 windows PCs spread out over eight offices in three different states.
