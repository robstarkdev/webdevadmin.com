    Anything you want to acheive in the browser, or on the server: I can do it. I produce high-quality code quickly, and charge competitive prices. I'm fully willing to work on a contract basis until an employer has the time and opportunity to fully assess the "proof in the pudding."  As to tools/technology: although I love Facebook's React library, I will use any programming language/library of choice selected by my manager. And the same goes for all coding practices and conventions already existing in the team/company for whom I work. If my employer needs me to learn something new to tackle a problem, I'll just do it.
    <br><br>
     My most recent employer was a company with gross revenues (2019) of $97 million, where I was part of a team of four programmers. I handled both front and backend tasks: from the creation of very complex SQL queries in the company API to complex vanilla javascript applications and user interfaces. After fourteen (14) months work at the company, they were sad to see me go (and are part of my references), but I was destined for warm weather and am not willing to continue living in the rainy and chilly Seattle-area. I was not terminated or let-go or down-sized in any way, for reasons of Covid-19 or otherwise. I left because I love warm, sunny weather. And detest the rain and cold of Seattle.
    <br><br>
    Depending on the needs of the particular task/project, I can use entity-relationship and use case diagrams in project planning.

        I am looking for a remote position, but plan on eventually living permanently in Florida or perhaps Texas.
